To Do: 
Have each node store the blockchain. 
Have each node broadcast to the other nodes when it hears about a new transaction
Have each node store at least one id of another node (Listening protocol)

Node

NodeID
Blockchain instance
List<Node> neighbours
List<Transaction> MemoryPool



Node on creation is handed an instance of the blockchain 
	Is handed a list of other nodes
	The node then connects to another node to ask the node to update the list with this nodesID

Node Tests:
	Create Node 
	Create Node With ID and Blockchain Instance 
	Create Node with NodesList 
	Create Node with NodeList and Add thisNode to the List
	Create Node with NodeList and Add thisNode to the List and update other nodes Lists
	Deactivate Node
	Deactive Node and update NodeList
	Deactivate Node and update all others nodes
	

Tests: 
	Create the blockchain
	Create Genesis block with no transactions
	Create a node
	Create a wallet
	Create a transaction
	
	- Sign transaction
	Use the private key of the 










Extra objectives: 
	- Have a wallet be distributable 
	- Have a node be distributable
